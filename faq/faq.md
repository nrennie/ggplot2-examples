# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is {ggplot2}?

{ggplot2} is a system for creating graphics, based on the Grammar of Graphics, in the programming language R. You provide the data, tell {ggplot2} how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details. The documentation is [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html).

### How do I install {ggplot2}?

Install {ggplot2} using the following command:

```
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
then load the package into your R session using:

```
library("ggplot2")
```

### How can I practice using {ggplot2} for data visualisation?

#TidyTuesday is a weekly data challenge aimed at the R community. Every week a new dataset is posted alongside a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask participants explore the data. You can access the data and find out more [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md).

Have a look at the [#TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TidyTuesday&src=typed_query) hashtag on Twitter for some inspiration.
