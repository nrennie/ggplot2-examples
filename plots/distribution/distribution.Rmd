# Distribution plots

Distributions plots are used to show the range of values that a variable can take. This section includes examples of:

* Density plots
* Histograms
* Boxplots
* Violin plots

in {ggplot2}. The data used in the examples comes from the `{palmerpenguins}` package. The `penguins` data set contains data on characteristics of different penguins. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
```
