# Correlation plots

Correlation plots are used to examine the relationship between two (or more) variables. This section includes examples of:

* Scatter plots
* Bubble plots

in {ggplot2}. The data used in the examples comes from the `{palmerpenguins}` package. The `penguins` data set contains data on characteristics of different penguins. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
```
